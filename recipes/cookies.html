    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a favourite that are undeniably tasty. The touch of flake salt brings the flavours out and gives the cookies extra character. Try doubling the recipe volume then freezing half of the dough so you can easily whip some cookies out and impress the room the next time an unexpected visitor comes around.</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180 °C</li>
            <li>Whisk the butter, sugar and muscovado sugar together at a high speed until fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla then mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Carefully add it to the butter mixture until mixed well into a dough. Add the chocolate.</li>
            <li>Roll approximately 18 balls from the dough. Evenly place them on two baking trays covered with baking paper.</li>
            <li>bake in the middle of the oven for around 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to rest on the trays for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Sprinkle a pinch of crumbled flake salt on top.</li>
        </ul>
